PROBLEM: Create a transparent audit systen for a table CLIENT_MASTER. The system must keep track
-------- of the records that are being deleted or updated. The functionality being when a record is deleted or modified the original record details and the date of operation are stored in the audit table, then the delete or update is allowed to go through.

SOLUTION:
---------
This trigger is fired when an update or delete is fired on the table client_master. The trigger
first checks for the operation being performed on the table. Then depending on the operation
being performed, a variable is assigned the value 'update' or 'delete'. Previous values of the
modified record of the table client_master are stored into appropriate variables declared. The
contents of these variables are then inserted into the audit table auditclient.


CREATE TRIGGER audit_trial
	AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON client_master
	FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
	oper varchar2(8);
	client_no varchar2(6);
	name varchar2(20);
	bal_due number(10,2);
BEGIN
	IF updating THEN
		oper := 'update';
	END IF;
	
	IF deleting THEN
		oper := 'delete';
	END IF

	client_no := :old.client_no;
	name := :old.name
	bal_due := :old.bal_due;
	INSERT INTO auditclient
	VALUES(client_no, name, bal_due, oper, user, sysdate);
END;
